## Frontend
The frontend is designed to offer a clean, intuitive, and engaging interface. Built using React and Tailwind CSS, it provides a responsive and visually appealing user experience. 

Key Features:
- **Story Generation**: AI-generated narratives based on selected genres and difficulty levels.
- **Hint System**: Up to three hints per story to assist users in making accurate guesses.
- **Customization**: Users can select the genre, difficulty, number of guesses, and language preferences.
- **App Logo Fetching**: When a user guesses the app correctly or runs out of guesses, the backend fetches the app's official logo from the iTunes API, enhancing the visual feedback on the frontend.

## Backend
The backend utilizes the Perplexity Sonar API to generate fictional stories inspired by real-world applications. Each story is crafted to subtly hint at a specific app, providing users with an engaging challenge.

Backend: [appwhiz-perplexity-backend](https://github.com/Elby2112/appwhiz-perplexity-backend)

## Frontend Setup
### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Docker
- Git

1. Clone the repository 
<pre>git clone https://github.com/Elby2112/appwhiz-perplexity-frontend.git
cd appwhiz-perplexity-frontend</pre>

2. Install dependencies
<pre>npm install</pre>

3. Run locally (development)
<pre>npm start</pre>

Visit http://localhost:3000 to see the app.

### Build and Run with Docker

1. Build the Docker image:
<pre>docker build -t appwhiz-frontend .</pre>

## Shared Instructions
These instructions overlap with the backend, so follow them accordingly:

- Ensure backend is running (default: http://localhost:8000)
- The frontend expects the backend API to be available at that address (changeable in environment config)
- For full functionality, backend environment variables and API keys must be configured properly (see backend README)

## How to Use
- Set your preferences: genre, difficulty, guesses, language
- Read the AI-generated story
- Use hints if needed (up to 3)
- Submit guesses until you find the right app or run out of tries
- Screenshots and usage details in the Examples section below.

## Tech Stack
- React 18
- Tailwind CSS
